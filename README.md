# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Purpose: This webpage will generate a password based on specific criterias through the use of alerts.

How it works: When the user presses the "Generate Password" button, a series of alerts will appear and ask the user on what they want the password to contain and also the legnth of the password.

Functionality: Each time the user presses "OK", a reconfirmation statement will appear based on whether they press "OK" for yes or "Cancel" for no

The user will be asked the following questions in order like:

1. How many charecters between 8 and 128, if they do not meet this criteria then a error aleart will appear
2. If they would like lower case letters
3. If they would like upper case letters
4. If they would like numbers
5. If they would like special charecters

After the five questions, a generated password will replace where "Your Secure Password" used to be

If the user did not choose at least one character type, an alert will appear telling the user so, after that the user would have to press "Generate Password" again.
